#' A passing sonar alternative to popularly used versions
#'
#' Think of the chart as a bunch of concentric rings. Each ring captures passes
#' falling within a particular range of lengths. The rings are equally spaced
#' so the increase in range from ring 1 to ring 2 is the same as the increase
#' in range from any ring n to ring n + 1.
#' The radius of the circle in the background of each sonar is proportional to
#' the length of the pitch. You can use that as a reference to get an idea of
#' how long a pass actually
#' Each block in the ring captures passes of the respective lengths in a
#' paritcular range of direction - specifically all angles originating from the
#' centre of the circles and passing between the left edge and right edge of
#' the block.
#' The blocks have been calculated in such a way to cover approximately the
#' same sized area of the pitch as any other block, which is why each block
#' spans a lesser part of the circumference on passes of longer lengths
#' compared to the part of the circumference it covers on passes of shorter
#' lengths.
#' The thickness of each block in the ring is proportional to the number of
#' passes of that length and angle. ( It's actuallly proportional to the square
#' root of the number of passes, if I make it proportional then the blocks with
#' few passes become too small to be visible. This is an acceptable workaround
#' to me since the idea is to give an indication of the number of passes, and
#' not really expect people to be able to infer the number of passes. )
#' The colour of each block is proportional to the success percent of the
#' passes associated with that block, going from red to dark green for 0% to
#' 100%
#' This function has only been tested with 120 X 80 pitch dimension dataset.
#' The more complex cases where the sonars are broken by pitch area, players,
#' etc. have also been tested under narrow conditions. Edge cases may break
#' this, in which case please post a bug report on Github or get in touch
#' on Twitter.
