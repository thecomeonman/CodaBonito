\usage{
fPassNetworkChart(
  dtPasses,
  dtPlayerLabels,
  nXLimit = 120,
  nYLimit = 80,
  nSegmentWidth = 1,
  cFontFamily = "arial",
  cForegroundColour = "red",
  cBackgroundColour = "black",
  cFontColour = "white"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtPasses}{a data.table with the columns playerId ( the player who
made the pass, ) recipientPlayerId ( the player who received the pass, )
Success ( 1/0 for whether the pass reached the recipient, ) x ( the
coordinate along the length of the pitch, 0 is defensive end, nXLimit is
offensive end, ) and y ( along the breadth of the pitch, 0 is right wing and
nYLimit is left wing. ) Refer to the dtPasses dataset packaged with the
library}

\item{dtPlayerLabels}{a data.table with the colums playerId ( same as
dtPasses, ) and playerName ( the label that the point of the respective
player should be labelled as. ) Leaving this blank will mean no labels in
the diagram. Refer to the dtPlayerLabels dataset packaged with the library.}

\item{nXLimit}{Length of the pitch}

\item{nYLimit}{Breadth of the pitch}

\description{
Plots a marker for each player at their median passing position, and draws
connections between players to represent the number of passes exchanged
between them
