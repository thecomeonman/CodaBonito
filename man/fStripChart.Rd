\usage{
fStripChart(
  dtPlayerMetrics,
  vcColumnsToIndex,
  dtMetricCategorisation,
  iPlayerId,
  cTitle,
  cFontFamily = "arial",
  cPlayerColour = "red",
  cBackgroundColour = "black",
  cComparisonColour = "white",
  cNeutralColour = "grey50",
  vnExpand = c(-0.25, -0.03, 1.03, 1.1, 1.15),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtPlayerMetrics}{A dataset with one row for each PlayerName, and various
metrics about the PlayerName declared in separate columns. Refer to the
dtPlayerMetrics dataset packaged with the library for an example}

\item{vcColumnsToIndex}{The non-metric columns in your dataset, these are
typically columns like name, age, team, position, etc.}

\item{dtMetricCategorisation}{A table with metadata about the variables in
dtPlayerMetrics. Refer to the `CodaBonito::dtMetricCategorisation` object
declared in the library for an example.}

\item{iPlayerId}{The ID of the player you want visualised}

\item{cTitle}{The title on the chart}

\item{vnExpand}{The X axis stretches between 0 and 1 but you need space on both
sides to fit the annotations. Specify what values the category label, the
stat value, and the comparison stat value should come at}

\item{compareWith, }{either 'median', another playerId, or NULL. If not null,
will add a second set of points for either the median or another player to
have some reference for the player you're looking at.}
