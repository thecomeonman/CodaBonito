#' Pass network ( WIP )
#'
#' Plots a marker for each player at their median passing position, and draws
#' connections between players to represent the number of passes exchanged
#' between them
#'
#' @param dtPasses a data.table with the columns playerId ( the player who
#' made the pass, ) recipientPlayerId ( the player who received the pass, )
#' Success ( 1/0 for whether the pass reached the recipient, ) x ( the
#' coordinate along the length of the pitch, 0 is defensive end, nXLimit is
#' offensive end, ) and y ( along the breadth of the pitch, 0 is right wing and
#' nYLimit is left wing. ) Refer to the dtPasses dataset packaged with the
#' library
#' @param dtPlayerLabels a data.table with the colums playerId ( same as
#' dtPasses, ) and playerName ( the label that the point of the respective
#' player should be labelled as. ) Leaving this blank will mean no labels in
#' the diagram. Refer to the dtPlayerLabels dataset packaged with the library.
#' @param nXLimit Length of the pitch
#' @param nYLimit Breadth of the pitch
